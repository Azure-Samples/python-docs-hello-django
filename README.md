# Python Django sample for Azure App Service (Linux)

This is a minimal Django app, without a database, that can be deployed to Azure App Service on Linux.

For instructions on running and deploying the code, see [Quickstart: Create a Python app in Azure App Service on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/quickstart-python).

## Changes to Django settings

This sample contains two modifications in the file *django_hello/settings.py*:

- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is set to include the value of the `WEBSITE_HOSTNAME` environment variable, if present. Azure App Service automatically sets this environment variable upon deployment to the app's URL.

- The `DATABASES` object is commented out (using """) so that the app doesn't attempt to use a database at all. To use a database, remove the comments and modify the values as appropriate for your database.
